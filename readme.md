## Project Overview
This project explored the use of RNN (LSTM, GRU) models for the classification of sequential data. Two distinct datasets were used: a handwritten character dataset and a consonant-vowel (CV) segment dataset. Different architectures were built and trained on each dataset, and the experimental results were analyzed.

## Tools Used
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Python
