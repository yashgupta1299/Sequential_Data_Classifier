# Sequential Data Classifier

### [Report-Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLUb6Fuq6E25hqYyaa6KziAnMqkrbiv70DYqSTOqZJ4/edit?usp=sharing)

> - Tools used: Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Python
> - This project explored the use of RNN (LSTM, GRU) models for the classification of sequential data. Two distinct datasets were used: a handwritten character dataset and a consonant-vowel (CV) segment dataset. Different architectures were built and trained on each dataset, and the experimental results were analyzed.
